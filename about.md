Welcome to the Coding Time with Nick blog. My name is Nick Freitas and this blog is a place for me post about the personal projects I'm working on. Take a look at [Projects](https://nick-freitas.github.io/projects/) to see all the projects. Follow me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/codingtimewithnick) to get notified when I go live. I am currently on hiatus on Twitch, but will be back streaming soon.
